Hi this is a repository created to tryout different settings on github and by the way back to basics of programming 

The problems were solved on python given that is a new language i'm still learning,the IDE was pycharm, but i'm sure that each .py file can be executed py without it

Any question feel free to ask on my twitter @JuxnCxrlosP
